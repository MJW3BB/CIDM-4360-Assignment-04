# CIDM-4360-Assignment-04

Objective: Assess your understanding functional modelling and use of UML use case and activity
diagrams
Skills needed: given a system description, you'll need to Know how to:
1- Identify functional and non-functional requirements of the system
2- Identify the system actors
3- Identify use- cases of the system
4- Create use case diagrams for the system to show how the actors interact with the system
5- Create activity diagrams for selected use cases.

# Description
Given	the	following	system	description,	analyze	the	system	and	answer	the	questions	below:
A	restaurant, that	serves	two	types	of	customers	(onsite,	and	offsite),	wants	a food	ordering	system	that	works online (via	
web	browser)	or	at	the	restaurant (via	touch	screen).	The	food	ordering	system allows customers to	personally	make	their	
orders, sends	 the	 orders	 to	 the	kitchen,	and	allows	managers	monitor food sold,	inventory,	and	generate menus	and	
reports. The	System Manager	manages	the	system	by	creating menus of	available	food	items	and	their	prices,	publish	it	
on	the	restaurant website	or	the	restaurant menu, and inventory	supplies.	The	Customer	creates	his	order	using	the	menu,	
makes	payment	for	his	order,	and	then	gets	a	receipt.	If	the	customer	is	offsite,	he	needs	to	input	his	delivery	(address)	
information with	his	order. Once	an	order	is	made,	the	system	updates	the	sales	data	 file,	and	sends	the	order	to	the	
kitchen	where	it is processed	 (ordered	items	get	prepared).	The offsite customer	can	 track	his	order	using	 the	receipt	
number.	After the	kitchen	processes the	order,	it	updates the	inventory,	and	sends the	food	to	the	delivery	clerk.	If	the	
customer	is	local	(onsite)	customer,	then	delivery	clerk	calls upon	the	customer	to	get	his	order,	otherwise	(it	is	an	offsite
customer) he	 attaches the	 customerâ€™s information	to	 the	 order,	makes delivery	 arrangement,	 and	 updates	 the	 order	
status.	The	General	manger	can	query	 the	inventory	and	sales	data	and	generate	financial	reports.	The	system	should	
maintain	the	customer	orders	for	at	least	2	years	to	allow	the	management	to	track	the	restaurant	growth	and	analyze	
customer orders over	years	to	help	them	make	strategic	decisions.

# Now	answer	the	following:
1- List	at	least	2	functional	and	2	non-functional	requirements
2- Identify	the	main	actors	in	this	system,	use	generalization	relationships	if	possible
3- List	the	main	(that	cover	all)	use	cases	in	this	system (no	more	than	10 and	not	less	than	5)
4- Create	a	use	case	diagram	of	this	system that	shows	the	associations	between	the	actors	and	the	use	cases	and	
relationships	between	the	use	cases.
